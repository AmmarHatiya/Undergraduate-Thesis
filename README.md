# Undergraduate Honours Thesis (2023-2024): Comparative Study on Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the undergraduate honours thesis titled "A Comparative Study on Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation".

## Overview

This repository serves as the home for the research conducted as part of an undergraduate honours thesis. The thesis explores the field of Visual Question Generation (VQG), focusing specifically on knowledge-based approaches.

## Thesis Abstract

Extracting information from images is an increasingly prominent task due to its expand-
ing utility and applications. Generating knowledge-aware questions (and answers) from images is a more novel approach that complements traditional image analysis techniques, and offers an interpretive method for understanding visual content. Knowledge-aware questions are designed to prompt responses that extract relevant information from only the subject image. We have conducted a comparative study to examine various techniques of generating knowledge-based questions from images, including prompt engineering of the latest large multimodal model (GPT-4V). Utilizing the model, we have employed various prompts aimed at providing context through both categorization and few-shot learning techniques. Alongside this, we employed a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) model for textual question generation, anchored in Semantic Role Labels, which used LLM-generated captions of the images as its input. We observed that the proposed categorization method delivered the best results on the quantitative metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, Semantic Similarity, etc.).
