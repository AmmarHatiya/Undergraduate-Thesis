# Undergraduate Honours Thesis (2023-2024): Comparative Study on Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the undergraduate honours thesis titled "A Comparative Study on Knowledge-based Visual Question Generation".

## Overview

This repository serves as the home for the research conducted as part of an undergraduate honours thesis. The thesis explores the field of Visual Question Generation (VQG), focusing specifically on knowledge-based approaches.

## Thesis Abstract

Extracting information from images is an increasingly prominent task due to its ever-expanding utility and applications. Generating knowledge-based questions (and answers) from images is a more novel approach of this that complements traditional image analysis techniques, offering a more interpretive method for understanding visual content. Knowledge-based questions are designed to prompt responses that extract relevant information from the subject image. In this study, we developed and examined various techniques for performing Knowledge-Based Visual Question Generation (K-VQG). These techniques included prompt engineering utilizing the latest large multimodal model (GPT-4 Vision) and employing sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models with semantic role labels (SRLs). Within the study, we employed various prompts aimed at providing context through both categorization and few-shot learning techniques. Alongside this, we implemented a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for textual question generation, anchored in semantic role labels, using LLM-generated captions of the images as its input. We observed that the proposed 2-shot learning method delivered the best results on the quantitative metrics (Semantic Similarity, METEOR, etc.).
